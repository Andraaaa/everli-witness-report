FBI Witness Reports API

Laravel REST API application for submitting witness reports related to FBI cases.
The API accepts the name of a person of interest (or part of a case title) and a phone number of the reporting user.
The system validates each report, and if all checks pass, it stores the data both in the database and in a separate JSON file.
